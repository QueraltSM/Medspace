<h1><b>Medspace</b></h1>
<b>iOS app for professional medical use</b><br><br>
Since the start of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, technology has played a greater role today, it has changed the way we interact with technology.
In the midst of this health crisis, we spend more time on mobile, according to a report by App Annie, the time spent on apps increased by 20% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2020 and consumer spending increased by 15 % on iOS devices and 5% for Android devices.
Health workers have also had to change the way they relate to technology in order to combine their training with long shifts at the medical center, which is why I considered that my greatest contribution with this final degree project was to create a space for doctors find a platform where they can stay informed of the latest advances and news in Medicine, interact with other colleagues in their profession and share experiences simply and easily by having the app at hand.
<br><br>
The day-to-day life of health personnel is really hard, and even so, they always continue to continuously train, the latest studies, tools, new technologies. Medspace was born to form a solid community "of doctors for doctors", to share and acquire knowledge, points of view, experiences and advice.
